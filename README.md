## Bit Ants : Efficient Task Scheduler
#### Enhanced Features:
* Dynamic Worker Management:
    * The scheduler allows for the adjustment of the worker pool size to meet varying workload demands efficiently.

* Rate Limiting:
    * It provides the capability to set limits on the number of tasks that can be initiated within a specific time frame, ensuring optimal resource utilization and preventing system overload.

* Adaptive Scheduling:
    * The system is designed to adapt to changes in task complexity and worker availability, optimizing the distribution of tasks to available workers.

* Load Balancing:
    * By intelligently distributing tasks, the scheduler prevents any single worker from being overwhelmed, thus maintaining performance and reliability.
